# Research Analyst Internship Summary at IFC (International Finance Corporation), World Bank Group
I worked as a Research Analyst Intern at IFC, World Bank Group from June 2022 to August 2022. The particular unit I worked for is the CDI unit for
Manufacturing, Agribusiness, and Services (CDIMA) under Sector Economics and Development Impact Department. This is a repo summarizing the work I did during my internship.

 My work includes the following three parts:
 ## Evaluate the healthcare system for developing countries by identifying the gaps between  demand and supply of the health facilities within the country
 - Predict the demand of health facilities based on GDP, population, births, and deaths through applying machine learning models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost)
 - Calculate the gaps between demand and current supply, and rank the gaps to determine the priority based on population density
 - Visualize the results as maps in QGIS
An example of Ghana shows as below:

## A preliminary analysis on the impact of climate change on economic activities in South Africa
- This is part of the World Bank's Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs) that integrate climate change and development considerations.
- Picked representative climate change variables including the increasing number of hot days, average temperature, and average precipitation
- Investigate the relationship between climate change variables and GDP & population through maps in QGIS
- Wrote an [academic report](https://github.com/ShiningYang0207/IFC_internship/blob/main/South_Africa_climate_change/CDI%20inputs%20to%20SA%20CCDR%2007%2021%2020222.pdf) with rigorous literature review and data analysis results

Examples of the maps are:

## A self-motivated task: developed Python code template to realize mapping automation in QGIS
- Wrote a python template to automate mapping process in QGIS, including adding vector layers, creating buffers, generating renderers based on GDP and population percentile cutoffs, customizing colors and symbols, etc.
- Compiled a [detailed documentation](https://github.com/ShiningYang0207/IFC_internship/blob/main/Pyqgis_mapping_automation/Documention%20for%20QGIS%20code%20template.pdf) of the instrictions on using the PyGIS template
